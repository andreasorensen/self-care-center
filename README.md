# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html). 

## Learning Goals

- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set


# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
//In this project I built an app/website using a COMP that displays a random mantra or affirmation depending on the user's input. Useres can choose one of two radio buttons, click the receive message button & the message of their choice would be displayed. I used an alert box for error handling, which appears when the user tries to receive a message without making a selection. I also create a clear button, which appears when the message appears & is hidden when no message is showing. This problem solves the problem of wanting a random daily mantra or affirmation, quickly without reading website after website... This app makes it easy & readily available.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They simply need to fork a copy from my github (git@github.com:andreasorensen/self-care-center.git) then clone it down into their local machine or they can run it directly from the following URL: file:///Users/andreasorensen/turing/mod1/self-care-center/index.html.


### Preview of App:
