# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
//In this project I built an app/website using a COMP that displays a random mantra or affirmation depending on the user's input. Useres can choose one of two radio buttons, click the receive message button & the message of their choice would be displayed. I used an alert box for error handling, which appears when the user tries to receive a message without making a selection. I also create a clear button, which appears when the message appears & is hidden when no message is showing. This problem solves the problem of wanting a random daily mantra or affirmation, quickly without reading website after website... This app makes it easy & readily available.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They simply need to fork a copy from my github (git@github.com:andreasorensen/self-care-center.git) then clone it down into their local machine or they can run it directly from the following URL: file:///Users/andreasorensen/turing/mod1/self-care-center/index.html.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I had a jam packed weekend due to the holiday, so I knew I needed to have it done by Friday, which I was able to do by working on it for about 3 hours Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday. I would have liked to accomplish another CYOA but since I knew I had to be sure to finish it, I was worried I wouldn't, so decided against it. I am 3 weeks into my Turing journey!

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

I was the only one who worked on this.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

One of the main goals was to gain experience using HTML, CSS & JavaScript together, which was super cool! It was interesting to use the provided COMP and mimic it. I also accopmpished the goal of listening to & responding to user inputs. During the paired project, I didn't do much with the buttons bc of how my partner & I divided the work, so I took advantage of the opportunity to get more familiar creating & listening to buttons with error handling.
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Dev Tools.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

One of my major wins is figuring out how to use HTML, CSS & JavaScript together! I loved figuring out how to hide the button using CSS, based on the .hidden class. That was major for me since I didn't want to use innerHTML. I really struggled to figure this out at first & was confused by some of the direction I received, so I went bcak to the drawing board. At one point, I had things working then I broke something & had to simplify and reconfigure, which is actually in my long-term benefit I think since it helps me understand the code more intimately (although I'm still not totally sure what went wrong!) Also, one challenge was knowing when to call it quits & also my gitflow still needs work!
